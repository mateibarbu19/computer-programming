## 1. Repository description

This project provides homework solutions for the Computer Programming course
taught at [Politehnica University of Bucharest](https://upb.ro), during the
first semester of the university year 2019-2020.

I created this repository for the following reasons:

1. the huge efforts I put in the [Tar Archiver](homework/3), **which was one of
    my best projects**
2. historical purposes

For more information or a syllabus check out the course description
[page here](https://cs.pub.ro/index.php/education/courses/58-under/an1unger/92-computer-programming)
. This course was taught by Florin Pop.

## 2. Acknowledgments

I would like to thank [Dimitrie David](https://github.com/dimitriedavid) for all
his support.
